Cloud Migration Tool 
This Python script leverages OpenAI's API to generate Terraform code for migrating resources from AWS or Azure to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Features:
Supported Source Clouds: Azure and AWS
Target Cloud: GCP

Resource Types:
Azure: Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, Network Security Groups, and more (through generic resource migration)
AWS: EC2 Instances, S3 Buckets, RDS Instances, VPCs, Security Groups, and more (through generic resource migration)

OpenAI Integration: Uses GPT-4 to generate Terraform code based on resource details.
Terraform Validation: Performs basic validation on the generated code.

Modular Design: Generates separate Terraform files for each resource, organized by source and target cloud.

Requirements:
Python 3.7+
Required Python Libraries:
requests
json
os
hcl2
dotenv
pathlib
subprocess
azure-identity (for Azure)
azure-mgmt-resource (for Azure)
azure-mgmt-network (for Azure)
azure-mgmt-security (for Azure)
boto3 (for AWS)
OpenAI API Key (obtain from https://openai.com/)
Azure credentials (if migrating from Azure)
AWS credentials (if migrating from AWS)

Instructions:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-migration-tool.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the project directory.

Add your OpenAI API key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Run the script:
python main.py

Follow the prompts:
Select the source cloud (Azure or AWS).
Provide the required credentials for the source cloud.

The script will generate Terraform code for each resource and save it to the terraform directory.

Review and Apply:
Review the generated Terraform code:
The script performs basic validation, but manual review is crucial to ensure accuracy and completeness.
You may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements and the target GCP environment.

Apply the Terraform code:
Follow the standard Terraform workflow to initialize, plan, and apply the generated code to your GCP environment.

Limitations:
The generated Terraform code may require manual adjustments and is not guaranteed to be perfect.
Not all resource types and configurations are supported.

The script currently focuses on infrastructure migration and may not handle data migration.
OpenAI API usage may incur costs.

Disclaimer:
This script is a starting point for cloud migration and should be used with caution. Carefully review the generated Terraform code before applying it to your GCP environment.
